# Maze Generator in Excel VBA

This is demo of how to use a Stack in VBA to create a simple Maze generator in Excel.

You can view a video of the project here: https://player.vimeo.com/video/254209200

The files have been separated from the macro workbook, so they can be version controlled in Github.

The instructions to rebuild the project are below.

However, if you just want to see the maze in action then open up the demo.xlsb file, and run the macro 'Start'.


## Setup with latest code files

Please do the following:

- Open up the file UI.xlsb
- Go to the VBA Editor
- Import the VBA class files: clsNextcell , clsStack, clsVisited
- Import the VBA module file: mdMaze.bas
- Run the macro 'Start' to see the maze get generated
- You run the macro 'ResetMaze' if you need to restore the UI to its default state.
